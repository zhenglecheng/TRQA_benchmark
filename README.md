## 🧠 Task Groups in TRQA
TRQA benchmark encompasses two groups of tasks with six diverse tasks designed to evaluate a model's ability of understanding the fundamental properties of time series data. 
The **TRQA** benchmark includes two major groups of tasks designed to evaluate different reasoning abilities in time series analysis.

---

### 🔹 **Conventional Tasks**

These are classic tasks widely explored in traditional time series analysis:

1. **🩸 Anomaly Detection** – Identify irregular or unexpected patterns in a time series.  
2. **🏷️ Classification** – Reason about the relationship between a time series and its underlying conceptual category.

---

### 🔸 **Advanced Tasks**

These novel analytical tasks focus on deeper, intrinsic properties of time series:

3. **📊 Characterization** – Infer fundamental properties such as trend, seasonality, and dispersion.  
4. **⚖️ Comparison** – Reason about relative similarities and differences between two time series.  
5. **🔄 Data Transformation** – Understand relationships between original and transformed time series (e.g., via Fourier transform).  
6. **⏱️ Temporal Relationship** – Capture chronological dependencies among time series patches.

---

> 🧩 **Insight:**  
> These **advanced tasks** push the boundaries of conventional time series modeling—encouraging the development of models that can **grasp cognitive concepts of time series** and **reason over human-posed questions**.
