## üß† Task Groups in TRQA
TRQA benchmark encompasses two groups of tasks with six diverse tasks designed to evaluate a model's ability of understanding the fundamental properties of time series data. 
The **TRQA** benchmark includes two major groups of tasks designed to evaluate different reasoning abilities in time series analysis.

---

### üîπ **Conventional Tasks**

These are classic tasks widely explored in traditional time series analysis:

1. **ü©∏ Anomaly Detection** ‚Äì Identify irregular or unexpected patterns in a time series.  
2. **üè∑Ô∏è Classification** ‚Äì Reason about the relationship between a time series and its underlying conceptual category.

---

### üî∏ **Advanced Tasks**

These novel analytical tasks focus on deeper, intrinsic properties of time series:

3. **üìä Characterization** ‚Äì Infer fundamental properties such as trend, seasonality, and dispersion.  
4. **‚öñÔ∏è Comparison** ‚Äì Reason about relative similarities and differences between two time series.  
5. **üîÑ Data Transformation** ‚Äì Understand relationships between original and transformed time series (e.g., via Fourier transform).  
6. **‚è±Ô∏è Temporal Relationship** ‚Äì Capture chronological dependencies among time series patches.

> üß© **Insight:**  
> These **advanced tasks** push the boundaries of conventional time series modeling‚Äîencouraging the development of models that can **grasp cognitive concepts of time series** and **reason over human-posed questions**.
